### *A lesson on data structures, networking protocols, data sanitzation and disclosure*

Around 2 years ago, I was enthusiastically working on Spigot and Bukkit along with a couple
of fairly popular plugins. During my poking around within the [networking internals of
Minecraft](https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft), I came across a fairly substantial 
problem that allowed anyone to send certain malformed packets and crash a server by 
running it out of memory.

Following the defacto standard procedure, I responsibly and privately disclosed the
problem to Mojang on 10th July, **2013**. That's nearly 2 years ago. I asked for updates
in one month intervals over the course of 3 months and was ignored or given highly
unsatisfactory responses. I kept my hopes up that the problem would be patched and checked
the source code on new releases whenever I could.

The version of the game when the vulnerability was reported was 1.6.2, the game is now on
version 1.8.3. That's right, 2 major versions and dozens of minor versions and a critical
vulnerability that allows you to crash any server, and starve the actual machines of CPU and
memory was allowed to exist.

### The technical details

The minecraft protocol enables the exchange of information about what an inventory slot contains.
This allows you to, for example, get the items in your hotbar when you log in. Items in minecraft
also contain a feature that allows them to store arbitary metadata (used for enhancements, books etc).
This metadata is stored in a format known as [NBT](http://wiki.vg/NBT). The NBT format is essentially
like JSON but in binary form. This allows it to store complex data structures with nesting and the like.

For example, the NBT metadata (known as a tag) for a book might look something like this

{% highlight javascript %}
tag: {
    author: "ammar2",
    title: "Kitteh",
    pages: ["Kitties are cute", "I like kitties"]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the client is allowed to send the server
information about certain slots. This, coupled with the NBT format's nesting allows us to
*craft* a packet that is incredibly complex for the server to deserialize but trivial for
us to generate.

In my case, I chose to create lists within lists, down to five levels. This is a json representation
of what it looks like.

{% highlight javascript %}
rekt: {
    list: [
        list: [
            list: [
                list: [
                    list: [
                        list: [
                        ]
                        list: [
                        ]
                        list: [
                        ]
                        list: [
                        ]
                        ...
                    ]
                    ...
                ]
                ...
            ]
            ...
        ]
        ...
    ]
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

The root of the object, `rekt`, contains 300 lists. Each list has a list with 10 sublists, and each of
those sublists has 10 of their own, up until 5 levels of recursion. That's a total of ``10^5 * 300 = 30,000,000`` lists.
And this isn't even the theoretical maximum for this attack. Just the nbt data for this payload is 26.6 megabytes. But luckily
minecraft implements a way to compress large packets, lucky us! zlib shrinks down our 
evil data to a mere 39 kilobytes.

Note: in previous versions of minecraft, there was no protocol wide compression for big packets.
Previously, NBT was sent compressed with gzip and prefixed with a signed short of its length, which reduced our maximum payload
size to ``2^15 - 1``. Now that the length is a varint capable of storing integers up to ``2^28``, our potential for attack has increased significantly.

When the server will decompress our data, it'll have 27 megs in a buffer somewhere in memory, but that isn't the bit
that'll kill it. When it attempts to parse it into NBT, it'll create java representations of the objects meaning
suddenly, the sever is having to create several million java objects including ArrayLists. This runs the server
out of memory and causes tremendous cpu load.

This vulnerability exists on almost all previous and current minecraft versions as of 1.8.3, the packets
used as attack vectors are the [0x08: Block Placement Packet](http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Player_Block_Placement) and
[0x10: Creative Inventory Action](http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Creative_Inventory_Action).

The fix for this vulnerability isn't exactly that hard, the client should never really send a data structure
as complex as NBT of arbitrary size and if it must, some form of recursion and size limits should be implemented.
These were the fixes that I recommended to Mojang 2 years ago.

### Proof of concept

A proof of concept of this exploit can be seen [here on my Github repo.](https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft/tree/nbt_exploit)
The code to generate the posioned nbt can be seen in ``start.py``. The code has been tested under python 2.7, once
you have connected to a server simply enter ``exploit`` in the command line and the packet will be sent to the server.

### Disclosure

I thought a lot before writing this post, on the one hand I don't want to expose thousands of servers to a major
vulnerability, yet on the other hand Mojang has failed to act upon it. Mojang is no longer a small indie company
making a little indie game, their software is used by thousands of servers, hundreds of thousands people play on
servers running their software at any given time. They have a responsibility to fix and properly work out problems
like this. In addition, it should be noted that giving condescending responses to white hats who are responsibly 
disclosing vulnerabilities and trying to improve a product they enjoy is a sure fire way to get developers dis-interested
the next time they come across a bug like this.
