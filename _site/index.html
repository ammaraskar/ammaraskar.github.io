    <h2 id="what-are-iclickers">What are iClickers?</h2>

<p>iClickers are used in a lot of colleges in order to conduct quizzes and take 
attendance. The whole ecosystem operates as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each student buys an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iClicker2-student-remote-iClicker/dp/1498603041/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538854585&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=iclicker">iClicker device</a>.
They’ve got some buttons on them to respond to multiple choice questions.
<img src="/images/iclicker/remote.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They enter the unique ID on the back of the device into their school
database.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each class is equipped with a base station that connects to the
instructor’s computer via USB.
<img src="/images/iclicker/header.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
With iClicker’s software, they can
conduct quizzes and export the answers for automatic grading.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="state-of-the-art-of-iclicker-reverse-engineering">State of the art of iClicker reverse engineering</h2>

<p>A significant amount of work has been as far as figuring out how the student
owned remotes work. The seminal work in this field is contained in this
<a href="https://courses.ece.ubc.ca/cpen442/term_project/reports/2010/iclicker.pdf">fantastic paper</a> 
conducted by some students at the University of British Columbia where they 
dumped out the firmware of the remote. Some key contributions they made were
figuring out the exact radio transceiver used in the device as well as the
obfuscation scheme used in the transmission of the IDs.</p>

<p>Following up to this, some students at Cornell started off a project called
<a href="https://github.com/wizard97/iSkipper">iSkipper</a> where they attempted to create
an open source alternative to the iClicker. By using logic analyzers and
dumping out the raw communications using a software defined radio, they were
able to piece together the protocol that the remotes use to send their answers
over the air. They wrote their own implementation of an iClicker that can be
run on an Arduino with just a 900MHz radio transceiver.</p>

<p>While the iSkipper project has managed to figure out most of the iClicker
protocol, one missing piece is the communication from the base station back
to the remotes. Upon pressing a button, the base station sends back an
acknowledgement packet to indicate that the answer has been accepted. In 
addition, the base station can also send a welcome message to the remotes to
indicate what class is currently in progress.</p>

<p>In order to figure out this last missing piece of the iClicker puzzle, I set
out to reverse engineer the receiver.</p>

<h2 id="acquiring-the-firmware">Acquiring the firmware</h2>

<p>The first part of reverse engineering the base station would be to obtain
the firmware that runs on it. Since I didn’t own a base station and didn’t
want to buy one (you can get them for anywhere between $50-$100 on eBay), I
had to figure out an alternative approach to acquiring the firmware.</p>

<p>Searching for iClicker base station firmware led me to the “iClicker Base 
Firmware Utility” on the iClicker <a href="https://www.iclicker.com/downloads">downloads page</a>.
This software claimed to be able to update the firmware on a base station so
it seemed like a natural target. I initially guessed that they would package the
updated firmware with the executable but searching around in the distributed
files I couldn’t locate any firmware files. Next up I ended up starting the
executable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iclicker/update.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>“Check for Update”, interesting. This was a massive hint that the updates
were most likely downloaded over the internet. Thus, I cracked open the
executable in IDA and searched away for interesting URLs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iclicker/strings.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Aha! <a href="http://update.iclickergo.com/ic7files/iclicker/QA/">http://update.iclickergo.com/ic7files/iclicker/QA/</a>.</p>

<p>Opening up this URL in a browser, I found that most of the files were updates
the firmware utility itself, but there were two very interesting files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>update_v0602.txt</li>
  <li>U_BASEU_V0058.txt</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a chunk of <code class="highlighter-rouge">update_v0602.txt</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>:100000000C942B010C9474120C9499120C94000013

:100050000C94000000002110422063308440A55021
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For those unfamiliar, this an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX">Intel HEX file</a>,
Getting into a binary format was as simple as:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">objcopy -I ihex update_v0602.txt -O binary firmware.bin</code></p>

<p>and with that, I had the firmware on my hands without having to install a JTAG
interface or an AVR programmer into a base station.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-engineering-the-firmware">Reverse engineering the firmware</h2>

<p>Alright so next up we gotta disassemble the firmware. I strongly suspected that
there was some Atmel chip inside the base station, just like the remote. Atmel
makes some very popular programmable microcontrollers, a lot of embedded
systems, IoT devices and the Arduino platform use Atmel chips.</p>

<p>Luckily IDA supports disassembling AVR, the architecture used by these
microcontrollers. So I cracked the firmware open in IDA and went to hunt down
the code that generates the acknowledgement packets.</p>

<p>There was a lot of code and I wasn’t exactly familiar with AVR so in order to 
get my bearings, I set out to find a known piece of the protocol: th scrambling 
and descrambling routine for the iClicker remote ID. The iSkipper project had 
already figured out <a href="https://github.com/wizard97/iSkipper/blob/c9a81d46491679ef925d359c865b17efc4248750/emulator/iSkipper/iClickerEmulator.cpp#L73-L79">the formula</a>
to do this:</p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So a good place to start would be finding functions that do a lot of bit shifting.
Searching for “lsr” (Logical Shift Right), I found a peculiar function:</p>

<div class="language-nasm highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">loc_375a</span><span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="n">lsr</span>     <span class="n">r30</span>
  <span class="n">lsr</span>     <span class="n">r30</span>
  <span class="n">lsr</span>     <span class="n">r30</span>
  <span class="k">ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In AVR, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsr</code> opcode shifts its argument register right by 1 bit, this looked
an awful lot like the initial part of the decoding algorithm so I followed to
the callers of this <code class="highlighter-rouge">right_shift_3</code> function.</p>

<p>There were some cool tricks that the compiler used, for example in order to
shift right by 7, it didn’t emit 7 <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsr</code> instructions. Instead, the sequence of
instructions was</p>

<div class="language-nasm highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">swap</span>    <span class="n">r30</span>
<span class="n">andi</span>    <span class="n">r30</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mh">0xF</span>
<span class="n">lsr</span>     <span class="n">r30</span>
<span class="n">lsr</span>     <span class="n">r30</span>
<span class="n">lsr</span>     <span class="n">r30</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">swap</code> instruction swaps the two nibblets of the byte, so the higher order
4 bites get swapped with the lower order 4 bits. Performing an and with <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xF = 0b1111</code>
after this essentially does the same thing as shifting right by 4.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <h3 id="a-lesson-on-data-structures-networking-protocols-data-sanitization-and-disclosure"><em>A lesson on data structures, networking protocols, data sanitization and disclosure</em></h3>

<p>Around 2 years ago, I was enthusiastically working on Spigot and Bukkit along with a couple
of fairly popular plugins. During my poking around within the <a href="https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft">networking internals of
Minecraft</a>, I came across a fairly substantial 
problem that allowed anyone to send certain malformed packets and crash a server by 
running it out of memory.</p>

<p>Following the defacto standard procedure, I responsibly and privately disclosed the
problem to Mojang on 10th July, <strong>2013</strong>. That’s nearly 2 years ago. I asked for updates
in one month intervals over the course of 3 months and was ignored or given highly
unsatisfactory responses. I kept my hopes up that the problem would be patched and checked
the source code on new releases whenever I could.</p>

<p>The version of the game when the vulnerability was reported was 1.6.2, the game is now on
version 1.8.3. That’s right, 2 major versions and dozens of minor versions and a critical
vulnerability that allows you to crash any server, and starve the actual machines of CPU and
memory was allowed to exist.</p>

<h3 id="the-technical-details">The technical details</h3>

<p>The minecraft protocol enables the exchange of information about what an inventory slot contains.
This allows you to, for example, get the items in your hotbar when you log in. Items in minecraft
also contain a feature that allows them to store arbitary metadata (used for enhancements, books etc).
This metadata is stored in a format known as <a href="http://wiki.vg/NBT">NBT</a>. The NBT format is essentially
like JSON but in binary form. This allows it to store complex data structures with nesting and the like.</p>

<p>For example, the NBT metadata (known as a tag) for a book might look something like this</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">tag</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">author</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"ammar2"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">title</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Kitteh"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">pages</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"Kitties are cute"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"I like kitties"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The vulnerability stems from the fact that the client is allowed to send the server
information about certain slots. This, coupled with the NBT format’s nesting allows us to
<em>craft</em> a packet that is incredibly complex for the server to deserialize but trivial for
us to generate.</p>

<p>In my case, I chose to create lists within lists, down to five levels. This is a json representation
of what it looks like.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">rekt</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>The root of the object, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rekt</code>, contains 300 lists. Each list has a list with 10 sublists, and each of
those sublists has 10 of their own, up until 5 levels of recursion. That’s a total of <code class="highlighter-rouge">10^5 * 300 = 30,000,000</code> lists.
And this isn’t even the theoretical maximum for this attack. Just the nbt data for this payload is 26.6 megabytes. But luckily
minecraft implements a way to compress large packets, lucky us! zlib shrinks down our 
evil data to a mere 39 kilobytes.</p>

<p>Note: in previous versions of minecraft, there was no protocol wide compression for big packets.
Previously, NBT was sent compressed with gzip and prefixed with a signed short of its length, which reduced our maximum payload
size to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^15 - 1</code>. Now that the length is a varint capable of storing integers up to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^28</code>, our potential for attack has increased significantly. (for the more technically minded people, we fill the list up with TAG_ENDs, which aren’t accounted for by the accumulator Mojang attempted to implement to fix this)</p>

<p>When the server will decompress our data, it’ll have 27 megs in a buffer somewhere in memory, but that isn’t the bit
that’ll kill it. When it attempts to parse it into NBT, it’ll create java representations of the objects meaning
suddenly, the sever is having to create several million java objects including ArrayLists. This runs the server
out of memory and causes tremendous cpu load.</p>

<p>This vulnerability exists on almost all previous and current minecraft versions as of 1.8.3, the packets
used as attack vectors are the <a href="http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Player_Block_Placement">0x08: Block Placement Packet</a> and
<a href="http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Creative_Inventory_Action">0x10: Creative Inventory Action</a>.</p>

<p>The fix for this vulnerability isn’t exactly that hard, the client should never really send a data structure
as complex as NBT of arbitrary size and if it must, some form of recursion and size limits should be implemented.
These were the fixes that I recommended to Mojang 2 years ago.</p>

<h3 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h3>

<p>A proof of concept of this exploit can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft/tree/nbt_exploit">here on my Github repo.</a>
The code to generate the posioned nbt can be seen in <code class="highlighter-rouge">start.py</code>. The code has been tested under python 2.7, once
you have connected to a server simply enter <code class="highlighter-rouge">exploit</code> in the command line and the packet will be sent to the server.</p>

<h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3>

<p>I thought a lot before writing this post, on the one hand I don’t want to expose thousands of servers to a major
vulnerability, yet on the other hand Mojang has failed to act upon it. Mojang is no longer a small indie company
making a little indie game, their software is used by thousands of servers, hundreds of thousands of people play on
servers running their software at any given time. They have a responsibility to fix and properly work out problems
like this. In addition, it should be noted that giving condescending responses to white hats who are responsibly 
disclosing vulnerabilities and trying to improve a product they enjoy is a sure fire way to get developers dis-interested
the next time they come across a bug like this.</p>

<h4 id="timeline">Timeline</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>28th July, 2013: First contact with mojang employee about the issue, vulnerability disclosed and proof of concept
provided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>19th August, 2013: Second time asking about fix, response given that its being worked on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>24th September, 2013: Third contact with employee, told that the problem has been delegated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25th October, 2013: Fourth time I attempted to contact employee, ignored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>27th October, 2013: Another attempt to contact, ignored again. (at this point, I patiently waited for a fix)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In retrospect, yes, I should have given them a final warning sometime recently before this but I just expected to be shot down again</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: With the release of this full disclosure I have actually made contact with mojang and they are working to fix the issue. Apparently the initial fix they tried failed which indicates a lack of proper testing.</p>

<p><em>Update 2</em>: The exact problem that caused this bug to go unpatched has been identified. Mojang attempted to implement a fix for this problem, however they did not test their fix against the proof of concept I provided, which still crashed the server perfectly fine. This, in combination with ignoring me when I asked for status updates twice led me to believe that Mojang had attempted no fix. In retrospect, a final warning before this full disclosure more recently was propbably in order. A combination of mis-communication and lack of testing led to this situation today, hopefully it can be a good learning experience.</p>

<p><em>Update 3</em>: This problem has been patched as of minecraft version 1.8.4</p>

<p><a href="https://mojang.com/2015/04/minecraft-1-8-4-security-release/">https://mojang.com/2015/04/minecraft-1-8-4-security-release/</a></p>

<p>I’m happy to see that multiple other security issues have also been fixed. Once again, I feel better communication would have easily alleviated this problem. Keeping me in the loop and not ignoring me, in addition to proper testing would have easily led to this exploit being fixed long ago.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: In regards to the statements that I never filed a report on their bug tracker, I’d just like to point out that nobody pointed me towards the tracker when I reported the issue, I wasn’t asked to make a ticket or told that I could follow the progress of the report on x-ticket.</p>

I was always really interested in making new projects for my arduino, the first of which was an LED music visualizer. The problem here was that arduinos aren't really popular in Pakistan, I had to get my current duemillenove shipped in from China thus getting an internet shield would be very difficult. One fine day I started thinking and said to myself, hey I nave a dedicated home server why not just hook up the arduino to that and write a program on the server to read that data through serial and use it somehow. Initially it was designed just to be able to read the current temperature, graphing was added in later.

Here is how it works:

The first part of the process is an arduino which has a  <em><a href="http://www.maxim-ic.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/2812" target="_blank">DS18B20 Temperature Sensor</a></em> attatched to it. Using serial communication, it sends out temperature readings to my dedicated home server.

The next part is a python script running in an infinite loop, it reads the values from the serial port and then proceeds to put them in a MySQL table, this occurs once every 2 minutes.
